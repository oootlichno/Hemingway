      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 â€“ July 2, 1961) was an American
        novelist, short-story writer and journalist. Best known for an
        economical, understated style that significantly influenced later
        20th-century writers, he is often romanticized for his adventurous
        lifestyle, and outspoken and blunt public image

      <h3>Life and career</h3>
      <p>
        Ernest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park,
        Illinois, an affluent suburb just west of Chicago, to Clarence Edmonds
        Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician. His
        parents were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park, a
        conservative community about which resident Frank Lloyd Wright said, "So
        many churches for so many good people to go to." When Clarence and Grace
        Hemingway married in 1896, they lived with Grace's father, Ernest Miller
        Hall,[5] after whom they named their first son, the second of their six
        children. His sister Marcelline preceded him in 1898, and his younger
        siblings included Ursula in 1902, Madelaine in 1904, Carol in 1911, and
        Leicester in 1915. Grace followed the Victorian convention of not
        differentiating children's clothing by gender. With only a year
        separating the two, Ernest and Marcelline resembled one-another
        strongly. Grace wanted them to appear as twins, so in Ernest's first
        three years she kept his hair long and dressed both children in
        similarly frilly feminine clothing.
